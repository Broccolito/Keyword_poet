A User-friendly interface based on Shiny Web App and internet crawler that helps look up Chinese poems and compose Chinese poems with words collected from web

Ribose keyword poet is an AI poet based on Internet crawling technique. Ribose can help user lookup poems from online sources as well as  automatically compose poems based on given source. The logistics behind poem composition is still under development.

Granted with absolute confidence, artificial intelligence and machine learning started from being a mere statistics computing technique but rapidly changed the way we look at them as well as the way we look at our world. Poems, fragments of language blessed with amazing human intelligence and beauty, have long been perceived as unduplicatable by machines and any other sources of intelligence other than that of human. However, as AI progressively blurring the boundary between Human and Machine intelligence, a lot less assumptions can be made these days about the privilege of human intelligence. Ribose keyword poet, a vanguard of digitalization of poems and composition of such, is taking a small step forward this one.

Ribose gets its name from its prototypical language R and Verbose. Moreover, ribose is also a Biochemistry terminology referring to a generally stable five-carbon cyclic structure. Ribose in Biochemistry is one of the most fundamental carbon structures essential to gene regulation. Altogether, the name suggests the bionic nature of this algorithm.

The team of Ribose is, and always will be, open to interested developers. This project is completely open source under MIT license. Project Repository: https://github.com/Broccolito/Keyword_poet
